# Module-6-Assignment
1. I tried the code below and revised it to the current time. By using the datetime import and creating a time_string object using datetime.now() I was able to find and print the current time.
2. 2. Added the timedelta to the datetime and subtracted 60 seconds and added 2 years (104 weeks). Then I also showed what the result would look like if I had only added one day to the current time.
3. Created a timedelta object that represents 100 days, 10 hours, and 13 minutes.
4. Wrote a function within a class that takes two arguments (feet and inches) and returns both of these arguments together with a datatime object.
